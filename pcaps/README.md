# Sample Packet Captures

## Overview

Sample packet captures used for testing were generated using the open2541 OPC-UA implementation and the Python OPC-UA implementation.  The sample packet captures have been named according to the implementation that generated them.  Additional information regarding these implementations can be found at:
