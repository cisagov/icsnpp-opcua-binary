# ICSNPP-OPCUA_Binary

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - OPC Unified Architecture Binary (OPC UA Binary).

## Overview

ICSNPP-OPCUA_Binary is a Zeek plugin for parsing and logging fields within the OPC Unified Architecture Binary protocol.

The OPC Unified Architecture defines three data encodings: - OPC UA Binary, OPC UA XML, and OPC UA JSON. This plugin targets the OPC UA Binary encoding.

Specification details can be found on the OPC Foundation Org website located [here](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture)

The initial implementation of the parser focuses on logging the message type, the service request and response headers along with any diagnostic and error information that may be present. The service numeric identifier and associated identifier string are also logged. However, the details of the service being called have been stubbed out for a majority of the services. Future development on the parser will focus on filling out this information.

This parser produces a variety of different log files. An overview of these log files can be found in the Logging Capabilities section below.

## Installation

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manger](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html)

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install icsnpp-opcua-binary
```

If this package is installed from ZKG it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -N`. If installed correctly you will see `ICSNPP::OPCUA_Binary`.

If you have ZKG configured to load packages (see @load packages in quickstart guide), this plugin and scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.
[ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)

If you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this package on a packet capture you can add `icsnpp/opcua-binary` to your command to run this plugin's scripts on the packet capture:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-opcua-binary.git
zeek -Cr <sample packet capture> icsnpp/opcua-binary
```

### Manual Install

To install this package manually, clone this repository and run the configure and make commands as shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/icsnpp-opcua-binary.git
cd icsnpp-opcua-binary/
./configure
make
```

If these commands succeed, you will end up with a newly create build directory. This contains all the files needed to run/test this plugin. The easiest way to test the parser is to point the ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to this build directory.

```bash
export ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH=$PWD/build/
zeek -N # Ensure everything compiled correctly and you are able to see ICSNPP::OPCUA_Binary
```

Once you have tested the functionality locally and it appears to have compiled correctly, you can install it system-wide:
```bash
sudo make install
unset ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH
zeek -N # Ensure everything installed correctly and you are able to see ICSNPP::OPCUA_Binary
```

To run this plugin in a site deployment you will need to add the line `@load icsnpp/opcua-binary` to your `site/local.zeek` file in order to load this plugin's scripts.

If you are not using site/local.zeek or another site installation of Zeek and just want to run this package on a packet capture you can add `icsnpp/opcua-binary` to your command to run this plugin's scripts on the packet capture:

```bash
zeek -Cr <sample packet capture> icsnpp/opcua-binary
```

If you want to deploy this on an already existing Zeek implementation and you don't want to build the plugin on the machine, you can extract the ICSNPP_OPCUA_Binary.tgz file to the directory of the established ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH (default is `${ZEEK_INSTALLATION_DIR}/lib/zeek/plugins/`).

```bash
tar xvzf build/ICSNPP_OPCUA_Binary.tgz -C $ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH 
```
